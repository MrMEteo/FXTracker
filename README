To install FXTracker:

Upload the Sources and Themes site to your ==LOCAL SERVER==. That's right, DO NOT USE THIS ON LIVE SITES. Crap doesn't work yet so if you do use it it's your fault if you get errors (technically mine but yours anyway!). There you have it.
Import the smf.sql file in phpMyAdmin.
Then run the installer provided to install the last hooks.

Please report any obvious bugs and errors to me in either PM on SimpleMachines.org or MAP3CMS.co.cc, or fire a bug report at http://map3cms.co.cc/forum/index.php?action=bugtracker;sa=new;project=1
